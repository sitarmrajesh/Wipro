1)Consider first element as sorted array.(always consider left part of the current element as as sorted and right to it as unsorted)
2)pick next element(from unsorted array).
3)Compare with elements in sorted array.
4)shift all elements in sorted array array which are greater that the value of current element.
5)insert the value.
6)Repeat until all the elements are sorted.

int inSort(int a[], int n)
{
  int i,j,current;
  for(i=1;i<n;i++)
	{
		current=a[i];
		j=i-1;
		while(j>=0 && a[j]>current)
		{	
			a[j+1]=a[j];
			j--;
		}
		a[j+1]=current;
	}
